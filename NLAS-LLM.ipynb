    "### Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to identify and extract named entities from text. Named entities are words or phrases that refer to specific entities such as people, organizations, locations, dates, times, and other types of entities that have a specific name or title.\n",

    "### To use the NLAS-multi corpus for training a NER model for our project, here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. We need to setup our environment and Download/load the NLAS-multi corpus data \n",
    " 2. We will Preprocess the data to a suit the format needed for training our model (Pre-processing).\n",
    " 3. We then convert the text and labels into numerical format that can be fed into a machine learning model (Feature Extraction).\n",
    " 4. Use spacy to build and train the NER model (Model Building and Training).\n",
    " 5. We evaluate the trained model and demonstrate how to use it for NER tasks (Model Evaluation).\n",
    " 6. Lastly, we develop a user-friendly interface to interact with the chatbot."
